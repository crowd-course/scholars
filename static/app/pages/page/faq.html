      <p>
        Stanford Scholar is an initiative by Stanford researchers to make research more accessible. The initiative
        facilitates people to collaborate and share their knowledge with others by creating short research talks on
        diverse topics in global languages.
        Following set of FAQs will help answer many questions about this initiative.
      </p>

      <h4>What’s the Stanford Scholar platform?</h4>
      <p>
        This initiative is an ongoing effort and supported through our open platform <a
        ui-sref="page.join">here</a>. Through this platform, anyone can propose a research paper of their interest and
        form a team to create a talk on it or join an existing team for another paper. You can also propose a paper
        co-authored by you. Currently, we’re only focusing on computer science conferences.
      </p>
      <p>The platform provides a suite of tools and integrates Google Drive and Slack to enable process oriented
        collaboration. Once onboarded, one goes through a 21 day cycle to collaboratively create the talk in an ad hoc
        team, where the members are responsible for designing the structure, flow and content of a 5-minute short talk.
        Members are free to collaborate in anyway they want. The talk is finally published on scholar.stanford.edu
        website and YouTube for larger audience. This is your chance to demonstrate your knowledge, impact research and
        experience a unique collaborative initiative.</p>

      <h4>Why collaborate?</h4>
      <p>
        There are thousands of high impact papers, whose findings are not accessible by most of the world. To scale the
        effort of accessible research knowledge, we got to get together. A high quality talk creation is a non-trivial
        endeavor and can be very time consuming. Through collaboration we want to change that, and scale the process of
        video production.
      </p>

      <h4>What will we produce?</h4>
      <p>
        The goal is to produce several talks on influential work in diverse areas - to prepare and educate researchers
        at all stages about novel and scholarly work.</p>


      <h2 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Applying and Participation</h2>

      <h4>How can I apply?</h4>
      <p>
        There is no application process, just sign up for the initiative via our platform <a
        ui-sref="page.join">here</a>.
      </p>

      <h4>Who is a talk representative/leader/DRI(directly responsible individual)?</h4>
      <p>
        A talk representative/leader/DRI is a person among you, who volunteers to co-lead the talk building effort. As a
        DRI, you will often be the person of contact for us. Your responsibilities may include: coordinating people and
        the process, improving, and synthesizing the content - you will be credited and acknowledged for your
        substantial contribution.
      </p>
      <h4>How large will be the collaborative groups?</h4>
      <p>
        The group size has no limits. However, a minimum of 10 people need to show interest for a given paper and the
        talk.
      </p>
      <h4>What is the selection criteria? What skill sets are required? </h4>
      <p>
        There is no selection criteria, anyone can join. However, you’ll enjoy the initiative if you’re passionate about
        research, collaborative in nature and willing to commit your time. Time commitment is important. Though no
        specific skill set is required, applicants are expected to have some level of expertise in the area of paper for
        which talk is being created. Don't worry about video making/editing skills, our focus is on helping you design
        and create the talk, not necessarily the video - we have a tool for that.
      </p>
      <h4>Can I propose a paper co-authored by me?</h4>
      <p>
        Yes, sure - if your paper gains interest within the community, you can start working on creating a talk on it.
        It's a great way to spread your research and produce high quality talk.
      </p>
      <h4>In what capacity can I contribute?</h4>
      <p>
        Any capacity, depends on how much time you can commit. You can lead an entire talk creation process to help
        fixing grammar issues in the talk’s content. You can help with a talk’s graphics to help design the structure of
        the talk. You can help converting a talk to a different language to giving feedback on an existing talk. There
        are many aspects of talk creation, and you can help with a variety of them.
      </p>
      <h4>Can I create a talk in a foreign language other than English?</h4>
      <p>
        Yes, sure - we have talks in Arabic, Hindi, Chinese, Spanish, Catalan and many other languages already. Please
        feel free to create a talk in the language of your choice.
      </p>
      <h4>Who is eligible to participate in this program?</h4>
      <p>
        To participate in the program, you must be 18 years of age or above. You can be a student, a professional or an
        enthusiast. You can come from any part of the world. Welcome, sky is the limit.
      </p>


      <h2 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Process</h2>
      <h4>What is the process of talk creation?</h4>
      <p>
        Once you join the platform, you can do one of the following: 1. Join an existing paper team and help with its
        talk creation, or 2. Propose a paper and form a team to lead it’s talk creation. Each talk has to be no longer
        than 5-minutes, and the talk development process takes 21 days (3 weeks).</p>
      <p>The process is divided into three phases as shown in the diagram below, starting with onboarding and team
        formation, followed by creation of slide deck and the script, finally recording audio and compiling video. Don’t
        worry about remembering this process, the platform will automatically transition from one phase to another and
        we have a tool for audio recording and video production.</p>
      <p>At the end of each talk creation, we will also publish your work on this website for a larger audience, as this
        program grows global.</p>
      <p><img src="static/img/workflow.png" style="width:100%"></p>
      <p>The program is an ongoing effort, and we hope to support it for multiple years. However, each talk creation
        takes about 21 days, so plan your commitment accordingly.</p>

      <h4>How many talks are created at one time?</h4>
      <p>
        At any given time no more than 10 talks are created. This means that other talk proposals are waitlisted while
        the talk creation is in progress.
      </p>
      <h4>What do I get out of this program? </h4>
      <p>
        Whether you're an experienced researcher or have never given a research talk before, we believe that this
        experience would be valuable if you like sharing knowledge with others. You get to demonstrate your knowledge on
        a Stanford platform, and help make research accessible. Not only your work will be viewed by people around the
        world, but we'll also notify original authors about it - and possibly get more people involved and
        connected.</p>
      <p>If we're creating a talk on *your* paper, due to its wide reach, it may help spread the word about your
        research and add more citations. Overall, this can help you build your résumé for grad school or job
        applications, gain visibility and reflect communication skills.
      </p>
      <h2 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Other</h2>
      <h4>What is your privacy and ownership policy? </h4>
      <p>
        Participation on the platform is voluntary. We will publish your work with your name on this website. We may
        publish aggregate patterns of communication and process (in a scholarly research venue) or exemplar contest
        entries that do not reveal the identity of participants. Also, we may follow-up with high-performing
        individuals/teams, to understand their approach for the program.
      </p>
      <h4>What is the affiliation policy? </h4>
      <p>
        If you want to update your resume or LinkedIn profiles stating this project. Please say "Participant at Stanford
        Scholar Initiative". Claiming yourself to be a researcher or instructor in this initiative can reflect false
        position. We often get inquiries about your affiliation - an incorrect one may reflect badly on you.
      </p>
      <h4>Does Stanford Scholar support only research talks?</h4>
      <p>We primarily support only research talks. However, we have experimented with long-format technical topics in
        past. You can access those <a ui-sref="page.technical">here</a>. </p>
      <h4>Who is behind this program? </h4>
      <p>
        We are a group of professors and researchers from the Schools of Engineering and Medicine at Stanford
        University.</p>
