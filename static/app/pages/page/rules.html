            <p class="lead">General: Stanford Crowd Course Initiative is now Stanford Scholar! </P>
            <p>
                The Stanford Crowd Course Initiative is an experimental program by Stanford professors and researchers
                to facilate students to share their knowledge with others and exploring the possibility of collaborative
                teaching or course creation. <br><br>

                As part of this program, you get to collaborate with other participants and create an online course.
                Together, as an adhoc team, you'll be responsible for designing the structure, flow and content of the
                course. You are free to collaborate in anyway you want, but over the internet. The topics can vary, but
                will be chosen by Stanford organizers of this program.

                Once your application is accepted, you get access to necessary resources and will receive
                feedback/mentorship from the professor about teaching and course creation. Your work may also be used to
                teach a real Stanford class and published on the website for larger audience (under Creative Commons
                license). This is your chance to demonstrate your knowledge and experience a unique collaborative course
                creation initiative. We may expect your time commitment to be about 5 hours/week, for 2-4 weeks. Please
                note that this is a voluntary program, and you won’t be monetarily compensated for your contribution.

            </p>
            <p class="lead">Data Collection and Privacy Policy:</P>

            <p>
                Participation in the challenge is voluntary, and you will not be penalized or lose benefits if you
                refuse to participate or decide to stop. We will not publicly disclose any identifying information about
                the team or individual, without obtaining their explicit consent - for example, at the time of
                publishing the course on this website. We may publish aggregate patterns of communication and process
                (in a scholarly research venue) or exemplar contest entries that do not reveal the identity of
                participants. Also, we may follow-up with high-performing individuals, to understand their approach for
                the program.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Risk and Discomforts:</P>
            <p>
                We anticipate no significant risks and no discomfort while you're participating in this program. You may
                request researchers to delete any data of yours from the research experiment at any time for any reason.
                As part of our research, in publications, we will make sure to exclude any information that can lead to
                identification of individuals, unless we have an explicit permission from you. While participating in
                this program, you may be expected to intereact with other participants via video conferencing meetings,
                where other participants might learn about your identity or email address.

                participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation
                at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. The alternative is

                research study may be presented at scientific or professional meetings or published in scientific
