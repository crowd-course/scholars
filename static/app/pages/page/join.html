      <p class="lead">Learn, Collaborate and Create Research Talks on Influential Papers in CS</p>

      <p>We're a thousand strong community who have been collaboratively creating research talks on multiple topics in
        computer science for almost an year. Our 150+ videos in more than 10 global languages have attracted about
        70,000 views and 1,000 subscribers to date.</p>
      <p>There are thousands of important research results that deserve more exposure. However, they’re in hard to
        understand format and many times behind the paywall. Our goal is to make the world's research more accessible,
        by collaboratively creating 5-minute short talks on influential papers. While creating these talks, not only
        you’ll learn about cutting-edge research, collaborate and discuss, but your work will be viewed by people around
        the world. </p>

      <p>Come join Stanford Scholar Initiative and help create talks in any language or contribute in any capacity.
        Anyone can join in, from high school to PhD students, in any area of computer science or technology.</p>
