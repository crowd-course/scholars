      <p class="lead">Learn, Collaborate and Create Research Talks on Influential Papers in CS</p>

      <p>We're a 500 people strong community, who have been working hard to collaboratively create research talks in
        multiple topics, in multiple languages. Our 150+ videos have so far attracted more than 15,000 views. In the
        spirit of making research and knowledge more accessible, we're starting this new effort! </p>

      <p>There are thousands and thousands of research papers that go unread, some are behind paywall, some are hard for
        non-researchers to read and understand - besides writing papers, researchers are unable to spend a lot of time
        making that valuable knowledge accessible. But we can help! </p>

      <p>Our goal is to make world's research more accessible, by collaboratively creating short 5 mins talks on
        influential papers, starting with CS. Not only you'll learn a lot, but your work will be viewed by people around
        the world. </p>

      <p>By signing up below, you're gonna be part of the STANFORD SCHOLAR platform, where you can collaborate and help
        science. This is the beginning of a high impact effort, and hope you'll join us! </p>

        believe in global reach and access! </p>

      <p>CONTRIBUTIONS: Creating content, voice over, video production, reviewing others work, research -- you can
        contribute in any capacity! Note: If you're a researcher yourself, feel free to pitch your paper too, and
        mention it in the extra question around the end - we'll make a talk of it soon too. </p>
